    Scenario: New intake for a patient with all documents already completed.

    Expected Behavior:
    The system should detect that all required documents (Lien, Photo ID, Pre-screen)
    are already on file. It should send a single SMS to the patient with a direct link
    to schedule their appointment, bypassing the multi-step intake process.

    SMS Template:
    "Hi [Patient First Name], we received a new imaging order from your doctor.
    Since your intake is already complete (thanks for that!), you can schedule
    your appointment online here: :arrow_right: [Scheduling Link] or call us at
    818-629-1169 (Mon-Fri, 8 AM â€“ 5 PM). We're happy to assist you!"
