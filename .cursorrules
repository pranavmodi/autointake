This is a python based repository for AI-Driven Intake & Appointment Reminder System for a company called Precise Imaging


We are implementing an AI-driven patient intake system to optimize scheduling, reduce no-shows, and ensure all necessary documents are completed before a patientâ€™s visit. The system will integrate with RadFlow 360 to track intake status, automate reminders via SMS and voice calls, and provide real-time AI assistance.  Human call will be used as last step to try and get the intake completed.


All important commands to start the server, run test files etc should be added to README.md
